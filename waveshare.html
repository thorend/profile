              <h3>Recently, I participated in an intense 9-week web development bootcamp at Le Wagon - and it was a true wave of change! 🏄‍♂️ Working together with a dynamic team, we developed a surfer app that brings surfers from all around the world together 🌎🏄. </h3>
              <h3>And let me tell you, the feeling when our ideas took shape and the app came to life was simply incredible!</h3>

              <p>One of these projects is the web app called "Waveshare," which aims to connect surfers worldwide and provide them with a platform to share their experiences, favorite beaches, and waves. The app allows surfers to exchange information about tides, wind conditions, and surf spots to ensure the best possible surfing experience
              In this project, I primarily worked on the backend, including the development of API endpoints, database management, and the implementation of the authorization function. The challenges during development provided valuable insights into project planning, teamwork, and problem-solving. The comprehensive program of the boot camp strengthened my technical skills and gave me a thorough understanding of agile development methods and team collaboration. Working in a highly practical environment enabled me to develop complex web applications and find effective solutions for real challenges.</p>
              <h4>Special thanks!</h4>
              <p>I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to my amazing team for their hard work and dedication during the development of the surfer app. Your commitment and collaborative spirit made this project a success, and I couldn't have asked for a better team to work with. Thank you all for your valuable contributions and for making this experience truly memorable! 🙏🏻🌟</p>
